cfstats-csv-parser
==================

Repository for a utility to parse cfstats into a csv file for analysis

In this repository you will find an executable jar as well as the source code for the cfstatsparser utility.  

The utility was built to provide an easily consumable form of the handy nodetool cfstats utility.  

The executable jar file is named cfstats-parser.one-jar.jar
  -- the jar takes 2 command line args
     arg[0] - the fully qualified cfstats file (source file)
	    - this file should be generated by piping the output of nodetool cfstats to a file
     arg[1] - the fully qualified .csv file (output file)

To execute the jar, copy the jar to a destination.  Then run the following command:

java -jar cfstats-parser.one-jar.jar [source file] [output file]
  - [source file] = arg[0]
  - [output file] = arg[1]

Once you have the output file, you can import it into Excel or another csv tool and then analyze the results, add graphs, format, etc.

This utility has been tested with 1.2.12 of Cassandra and DSE 3.1.2.  It also includes two "newish" metrics, which if not present via nodetool cfstats will be blank.

Version 0.1 of the cfstatsparser has the following issues:
-  No loggin support
-  Very little exception handling
-  It's essentially a quick-and-dirty build
-  Only one output format

Please feel free to augment the tool with your additions.
